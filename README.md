# DQ9-Menu
A menu for tracking stats / money for Dragon Quest 9 
This curses command line menu is meant to be used 
for one of my favorite games: Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies

This menu is mainly used for keeping track of the amount of money needed to buy what you want from shops.

Features that may be cool to implement:
 - list of items in the game so I can input what I want and it automatically works out the total
 - Graphs and statistics showing how many monsters, at what level, area etc would be most efficent to
 kill to get the money quickly with current armour / weapon / level / access to areas.
 - Eventually calculating best way to do other things, such as level up in my current state 
 or easiest way to get certain alchemy ingredients more efficiently.
